# SmartCompetitionHome_2016
Smart competition home project for Elment14 PiIoT challenge
https://www.element14.com/community/community/design-challenges/pi-iot/blog/authors/clazarom

We developped a smart-home, including a competition system. In this repository, we include the source code of the three main components:
- Central Node: a Raspberry Pi 3
- Sensors Node: a Raspberry Pi 1
- User phone: an Android smartphone

## Central Node
Runs a MQTT Broker: it receives data from MQTT publishers and lets MQTT subscribers read them
Runs a python script which will:
- Read data from broker (originally generated by sensors node)
- Display that data
- Store that data

## Sensors Node
Runs a python script which will:
- Fetch data from different sensors
- Send that data to the broker (central node)

## User phone
Two Androida applications: one to work as a user interface for the smart home and the other to run the competition game

### Smarthome app
- Read data from broker (originally generated by sensors node)
- Display that data
- Include some commands to interact with the central node

### Competition app
<To be developped>
